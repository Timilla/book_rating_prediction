# book_rating_prediction
The aim of this endeavor is to develop a predictive model for book rating. The project encompasses several key steps, including the importation of necessary libraries, loading of datasets, exploration of the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) for feature engineering, preprocessing of the data, and ultimately the construction, selection, and evaluation of predictive models. These steps collectively form a comprehensive workflow for achieving the project's goal.
